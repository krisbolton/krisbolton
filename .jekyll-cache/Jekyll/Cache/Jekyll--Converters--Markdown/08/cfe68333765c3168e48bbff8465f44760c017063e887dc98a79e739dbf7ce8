<p>This type of â€˜attackâ€™ appears unlikely and incomprehensible to the public being manipulated would find this difficult to beleive. The more a campaign is reminicent of a conspiracy theory, the more operational protection it is afforded by a cloak of confusion and deniability. This becomes increasinly true as bizzare conspiricy theories and associated groups become known to the public more commonly (e.g. QAnon). The public, often a pressure on politicans - whom themselves are the tools that are often required to take action at a national level - are unaware, unsure or deny, security services are slowed attempting to desern what is real and what is not,.</p>
