<p>Humans canâ€™t predict the future, but we can use <em>futures</em> methodologies to create possible scenarios, identify critical uncertainties and drivers of change to explore forks, consider risks and anticipate challenges. This is what I do.</p>

<p><em>Futures</em>, <em>foresight</em>, and <em>futurecasting</em> are phrases which may be used to describe this discipline. In academia it is known as <em>future studies</em>. I will refer to the subject as futures. Futures is a well-established field originating in the 1960s. Today it is used by businesses, governments and academics as part of strategic planning, risk analysis and oppurtunities research.</p>

<p>I design and run futures methodologies to collate and derive insight from multiple experts and stakeholders to answer questions of importance. I also conduct independent research to analyse the future cyber security landscape.</p>

<p>Research and materials coming soon.</p>

</ul>

<p>In an industry where much of the talent is composed of freelancers, where few are retained within academia, and considering the necessity of remote-only practice, a new approach is required. I use the phrase <em>open futures</em> to refer to futures research which implements an altered approach to deal with these challenges. The research created is made freely available to the community.</p>

<p>This scenario explores how advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) may effect the tools, techniques and behaviour of threat actors focused on the period 2021-2026. Attention is paid to the effect of landmark advanced machine learning models such as GTP-3.</p>
