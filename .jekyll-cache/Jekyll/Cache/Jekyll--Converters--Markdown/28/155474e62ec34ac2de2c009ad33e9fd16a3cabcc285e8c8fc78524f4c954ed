<p>This is the proclamation on the copyright page of â€˜The C Programming Bookâ€™. It crosses my mind I am writing this review on a Mac running OS X, a distant child of the 9th Edition of UNIX thirty-seven years later.</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>In its fifty-second printing the book is a classic computer science text. It is so revered among computer scientists because the original creator of C, Dennis Ritchie, is one of the authors. â€˜The C Programming Languageâ€™ aims to teach beginnerâ€™s the C programming language from scratch via a quick â€œTutorial introductionâ€ and a series of example programs exploring various facets of the language in increasing difficulty.</p>

<p>The second edition, and the most recent, was first printed in 1989 to include the various changes and additions after the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) created the C89/C90 standards, which for standardised the language for the first time. Despite being in its fifty-seventh printing, it hasnâ€™t been updated in twenty-seven years, and as a result it is starting to show its age â€“ if only in it use of language.</p>

<p>â€˜The C Programming Languageâ€™ is noticeably â€˜stuffyâ€™ and verbose. At times it approaches a technical manual to my modern eyes. However, if this is the only major weakness, it can be overlooked due to the books status and relevant content. Yet, despite my nostalgia and reverence for â€˜The C Programming Languageâ€™ I would argue there are much better books to learn C.</p>

<h3 id="comparison">Comparison</h3>
<p>When compared to modern texts such as â€˜Learning C the Hard Wayâ€™, â€˜The C Programming Languageâ€™ immediately looks wrinkled. This comparison is particularly apt as they each teach C in a similar way â€“ through practical, increasingly difficult programming examples. In â€˜Learn C the Hard Wayâ€™ succinct, lively, but professionally written chapters replace the verbose, stuffy language of â€˜The C Programming Languageâ€™. In â€™Learn C the Hard Wayâ€™ each chapter sets out a programming task centred around a language feature, each task builds a real-world program. While the authors of â€˜The C Programming Languageâ€™, state â€œwe have tried where possible to show useful programming techniquesâ€, and â€œwhen forced to make a decision [on what to include], we have concentrated on the languageâ€. This is not unreasonable, yet, â€˜Learn C the Hard Wayâ€™ manages to create real-world â€œcomplete programsâ€ and show off features of the language at the same time.</p>

<p>Regardless of the criticism of the language of â€˜The C Programming Languageâ€™ is unsurpassed as a technical reference. And despite its stuffiness and verbosity it does a good job of guiding the reader through aspects of the language. The authors concentration on the language is clear, and the result is a perfectly usable, but inferior to modern texts, introduction to C.</p>

<h3 id="contents">Contents</h3>
<p>The book starts with â€˜Chapter 1: Tutorial Introductionâ€™, a 34 page, fast-paced, practical introduction to the language which encourages readers to write â€œcomplete programsâ€ using the major features of C. This format is useful to the reader because they have gained some practical knowledge, so when they read the detailed sections which deal with those features they are more likely to understand the explanation. The book assumes the reader already has some basic programming knowledge, of compilation and algebraic expressions.</p>

<p>Chapters 2 through 6 cover those features, and others, in greater detail. The chapters keep the focus on writing â€œcomplete programsâ€, as opposed to code snippets, which arguably leads to greater usefulness and comprehension for the reader. Chapter 7 describes the standard library, Chapter 8 deals with the interface between C programs and the UNIX operating system, and the final section, Appendix A, contains a reference manual.</p>

<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>â€™The C Programming Languageâ€™ is still a useful book to learn the C language, however let us not be held back by nostalgia and unmoving reverence. The book holds up surprisingly well for a twenty-seven-year-old revision of a thirty-seven-year-old book (its original printing). I argue if you are to buy only one book to learn C, donâ€™t spend Â£33 on â€˜The C Programming Languageâ€™. Consider â€˜Learn C the Hard Wayâ€™, or another modern text. Have a look at some of the free PDF books which have gained popularity such as â€˜Modern Câ€™ from Prof. Jens Gustedt, a French academic and ISO expert in C.</p>

<p>â€˜The C Programming Languageâ€™ can have a place on your bookshelf, but only among other C programming books.</p>
