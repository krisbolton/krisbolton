<p>Humans canâ€™t predict the future, but we can use <em>futures</em> methodologies to create possible scenarios, identify critical uncertainties and drivers of change to explore forks, consider risks and anticipate challenges. This is what I do.</p>

<p><em>Futures</em>, <em>foresight</em>, and <em>futurecasting</em> are phrases which may be used to describe this discipline. In academia it is known as <em>future studies</em>. I will refer to the subject as futures. Futures is a well-established field originating in the 1960s. Today it is used by businesses, governments and academics as part of strategic planning, risk analysis and oppurtunities research.</p>

<p>I design and run futures methodologies to collate and derive insight from multiple experts and stakeholders to answer questions of importance. I also conduct independent research to analyse the future cyber security landscape.</p>

<p>Research and materials coming soon.</p>
