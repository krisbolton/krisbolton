<p>In late 2018 I started sending Freedom of Information Requests (FOI) to various UK Government Departments, Agencies and Non-Governmental Bodies asking them to disclose their yearly spending data on cyber security.</p>

<p>My assertion is cyber security spending is an indication of the overall security of an organiation and how seriously they take security.</p>

<p>Initially I started with services which can be considered of naitonal importance, and the lack of security could be considered a risk to national security. This post will briefly dicuss the responses of UK national ambulance services from Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England.</p>

<h3 id="the-foi-request">The FOI Request</h3>

<p>Each Department, Agency or Non-Governmental Body was asked to provide the same information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Provide the total amount of money spent on Cyber Security for financial years 2015-18.</li>
  <li>The term â€œCyber Securityâ€ is defined as: â€œâ€¦ consider the term to encompass activities relating to information security, computer security and computer network security. Including staff training, consultant services, software and hardware.â€</li>
  <li>Additionaly, â€œDetails on what training and consultant services were for â€¦â€</li>
</ul>

<p>At the time of the request (December 2018) this would provide approximately three years of data.</p>

<p>All of the information I collect and the exact request wording is available on <a href="https://github.com/krisbolton/UK-Cyber-Security-Spending-Data">GitHub</a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-results-so-far">The Results So Far</h3>

<p>I havenâ€™t finished recieving the data from some of the ambulance services, notably the West Midlands and South Central - theyâ€™re overdue. Iâ€™ll be following up soon. Additionally, due to the structure of some of the services, namely the three remote island services; Guernsey, Isle of Man and States of Jersey, I have found it difficult to contact the appropraite people. Eventually this will be complete.</p>

<p>It must be pointed out I am not a statistician, and as different entities do not record or store financial data in the same way this make analysis difficult.</p>

<p>OK! On to some results.</p>

<p>It is clear there is a large disparity between the spending of some abulance services compared to others. Excluding outliers, and focusing on a particular category, Network Security for example, and the financial year 2016/7, East Midlands spent Â£1,275, North East Ambulance spent Â£4,175 and the Welsh service spent Â£46,947.</p>

<p>East Midlands Ambulance Service spends significantly different amounts per year, although the default appears to be very low - they did not specificy details so it is difficult to analyse. In 2015 and 2018 they spend over Â£100,000, while 2016 and 2017 they spent a mere Â£1,275 each year.</p>

<p>The North East Ambulance Service is consistent in its spending on Network Security over the year period that they provided data. In 2015 and 2016 they spent Â£4,175 and Â£4,000 in 2018. While in 2017 they spent Â£57,375, the increase was indicated as capital expenditure on improvements in perimeter security.</p>

<p>The Welsh Ambulance Service is somewhat similar to East Midlands, although there is perhaps a trend towards higher spend after WannaCry(?). They spent Â£5,337 in 2015/6, and Â£46,793 and Â£54,727 in 2016/7 and 2017/8 respectively.</p>

<p>It is difficult to analyse due to the lack of insight into how they are actually spending the money. However, it isnâ€™t possible to obtain this data due to the security risk of providing detailed explanations of such spending. I purposefully suggested recipients do not include specifics for this reason.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s going to be an interesting project once it is complete. I also intend to collect data from the other services; police and fire. As well as Government Departments.</p>

<p>Keep an eye on the <a href="https://github.com/krisbolton/UK-Cyber-Security-Spending-Data">GitHub</a> for regular updates, or check back here in a month or two.</p>

<p><em>Update 2020</em>: This project is closed. Data collected is still available in the GitHub repo mentioned above. At some point I would like to do this project again with new data and complete the FOI requests to all the services and departments.</p>
