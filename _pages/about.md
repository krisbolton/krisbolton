**Hello there, I'm Kris**. I am the creator of <a href="https://security.kiwi" target="_blank">Security Kiwi</a>, a security-focused course teaching machine learning techniques to programmers. I also help people understand and answer important questions about the future of the security landscape utilizing my research background and [futures](/futures) techniques.

I'm a graduate of the Wolverhampton Cyber Research Institute's MSc Cyber Security programme. Where I focused on nation-state and criminal actors and the use of machine learning to project attacker movements within networks. Previously, I studied BSc Computer Science, which provides my technical foundation. I am passonate about cyber security and maintain memberships to strategic thinktanks in the UK.
