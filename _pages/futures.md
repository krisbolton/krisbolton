Humans can't predict the future, but we can use *futures* methodologies to create possible scenarios, identify critical uncertainties and drivers of change to explore forks, consider risks and anticipate challenges. This is what I do.

*Futures*, *foresight* and *horizon scanning* are phrases which may be used to describe this discipline. In academia it is known as *future studies*. I will refer to the subject as futures. Futures is a well-established field originating in the 1960s. Today it is used by businesses, governments and academics as part of strategic planning, risk analysis and oppurtunities research.

I design and run futures methodologies to collate and derive insight from multiple experts and stakeholders to answer questions of importance. I also conduct independent research to analyse the future cyber security landscape.

Research and materials coming soon.
