We can't predict the future, but we can use *futures* methodologies to create possible scenarios, identify critical uncertainties and drivers of change to explore forks, consider risks and anticipate challenges.

*Futures*, *foresight*, and *futurecasting* are phrases which may be used to describe this discipline. In academia it is known as *future studies*. I will refer to the subject as futures. Futures is a well-established field originating in the 1960s. Today it is used by businesses, governments and academics as part of strategic planning, risk analysis and oppurtunities research.

I design and run futures methodologies to collate and derive insight from multiple experts and stakeholders to answer questions of importance. I also conduct independent research to analyse the future cyber security landscape.

## Materials

* [Protocols for Open Futures]() (coming soon)

In the information security industry few individuals have contact with, or stay within academia,  talent is transient as individuals move, and considering remote-only practice, a new approach is required to access the knowledge within industry. I use the phrase *open futures* to refer to futures research which alters the traditional approach of academic-only experts to rebuff these challenges and improve access to knowledge. Open futures research is just that; participation has fewer barriers and the results of research are made available to the security community.

## Research

* [Advances in Natural Langauge Processing]() (coming soon)

This scenario explores how advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) may effect the tools, techniques and behaviour of threat actors focused on the period 2021-2026. Attention is paid to the effect of landmark advanced machine learning models such as OpenAI's GTP-3 and EleutherAI's GTP-Neo.
