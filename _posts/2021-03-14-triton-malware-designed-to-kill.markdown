The discovery of the Triton attack framework marked the first time industrial control system (ICS) malware was discovered to effect industrial safety systems [10, 11], and thus directly threaten human life. The real-world motivation for this design choice isn't clear; as easy as it is to focus on the probability of deaths when disabling safety systems, that isn't the main function of Triton, although deaths may increase the probability of the attackers objectives being fufilled and fufiled for a longer period. The design decision to effect safety systems is more likely to be the optimal choice to shut down a factory or process within it, rather than specifically to kill. However, any on-site deaths may encoruage managers to shutdown, or workers to refuse, meeting the attacker objective of factory disruption or shutdown. Consider Stuxnet, the objective there is well-agreed to have been the physical destruction of industrial centrifuges used in the enrichment of uranium by Iran. The mission objective to distupt Iranian uranium enrichment was successful, but new equiptment can be purchased, although time consuming network incident response can be completed within weeks, and every other on-site process was unaffected. Triton has the potential to shut down entire industrial sites because they become unsafe, with the potential that surpassing safety thresholds may also lead to physical damage of equiptment. To date, only two instances of Triton infection have been observed, both within the Middle East [11].
