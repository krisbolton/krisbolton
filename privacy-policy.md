### Information Collected
We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so–for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better.

We collect information in three ways: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our Services, and from outside sources. Let’s go over the information that we collect.

#### Information You Provide Through Actions
It’s probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us. The amount and type of information depends on the context and how we use the information. Here are some examples:

__Email Signup:__ If you sign up for a newsletter you will share informaiton about yourself via the signup form.

__Transaction and Billing Information:__ If you buy something from us –a book for example – you will provide additional personal and payment information that is required to process the transaction and your payment, such as your name, credit card information, and contact information.

__Communications with Me:__ You may also provide information when you contact me via the contact page.


#### Information Collected Automatically
Some information is colled automatically:

__Usage Information:__ Information about your usage of this website. For example, information about the actions users perform–in other words, what you did, when and to what thing on a site (e.g. a button click). We also collect information about what happens when you use our Services (e.g., page views) along with information about your device (e.g., screen size, name of cellular network, and mobile device manufacturer). We use this information to, for example, provide services to you, as well as get insights on how people use this website, so it can be improved.

__Location Information:__ The approximate location of your device from your IP address, from within Google Analystics (your IP address remains hidden to me). This information is used to, for example, calculate how many people visit this website from certain geographic regions.

__Information from Cookies & Other Technologies:__ A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and emails. This website uses cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences, as well as track and understand email campaign effectiveness and to deliver targeted ads.

### How and Why Your Information is Used

- To monitor and analyze trends and better understand how users interact with this website, which helps improve this website and make it easier to use;
- To measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of advertising, and better understand user retention and attrition — for example, we may analyze how many individuals purchased a book after receiving a marketing message;
